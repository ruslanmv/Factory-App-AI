# Factory App AI

![alt text](./assets/logo-small.jpg)

Factory App AI is an innovative application that enables users to dynamically generate project structures and code using generative AI models, including ChatGPT by OpenAI. The app provides a user-friendly interface powered by Gradio to define project requirements, generate files, validate outputs, and containerize the projects for deployment. This application is designed to streamline project development but may require manual adjustments to the generated content for optimal functionality.

> **Note:** This project implements the **Standard Method** as referenced in [arXiv:2411.10861](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10861).

## Features

- **Dynamic Project Tree Generation**: Generate project structures based on user input and selected frameworks.
- **File Generation**: Create project files with dependency handling.
- **File Validation**: Validate generated files and ensure all dependencies are met.
- **File Explorer**: Browse and inspect generated project files.
- **Containerization**: Automatically generate Dockerfiles and save projects as zip files for deployment.
- **Interactive Gradio Interface**: User-friendly UI to guide through the process.
